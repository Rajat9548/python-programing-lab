What are the possible outcome(s) executed from the following code ?
import random
def main():
    p = "MY PROGRAM"
    i = 0
    while p[i] != "R":
        l = random.randint(0,3) + 5
        print (p[l],end ="_")
        i += 1
main()
(i)	(ii)	(iii)	(iv)
M_M_Y_P	R_G_A_G	G_G_R_O	O_G_G_A
Ans. (i) will not be printed
