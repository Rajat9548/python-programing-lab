What are the possible outcome(s) from the following code? Also, specify the maximum and minimum values that can be assigned to variable SEL.
import random
SEL=random. randint (1, 3)
ANIMAL = ["DEER", "Monkey", "COW", "Kangaroo"]
for A in ANIMAL:
    for AA in range (0, SEL):
        print (A, end ="")
    print ()
(i)	(ii)	(iii)	(iv)
DEERDEER	DEER	DEER	DEER
MONKEYMONKEY	DELHIMONKEY	MONKEY	MONKEYMONKEY
COWCOW	DELHIMONKEYCOW	COW	KANGAROOKANGAROOKANGAROO
KANGAROOKANGAROO		KANGAROO	
Ans. Maximum value of SEL is 3 and minimum is 1
         (iv) is the correct option.
